# Digital-Steganography-Numerical-Analysis-SVD-Implementation-in-Python

This project implements a robust digital image steganography technique using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It features a custom, manual implementation of SVD using the Power Method with Deflation for educational analysis, benchmarked against NumPy's optimized LAPACK routines. The algorithm embeds text data into the singular value spectrum (spectral domain) of an image, demonstrating concepts of numerical stability, matrix factorization, and signal processing.  
To use the jupyternotebook code please change the name of the "FILENAME" and "MESSAGE" variables into the picture name in which you want to hide the message, respectively into the message which you want to hide, also don't forget to upload the photo in the same directory as the code for it to work.  
Thank you and have fun with it!
