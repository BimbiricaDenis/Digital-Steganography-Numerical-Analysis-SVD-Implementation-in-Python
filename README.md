# Digital-Steganography-Numerical-Analysis-SVD-Implementation-in-Python

This project implements a robust digital image steganography technique using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It features a custom, manual implementation of SVD using the Power Method with Deflation for educational analysis, benchmarked against NumPy's optimized LAPACK routines. The algorithm embeds text data into the singular value spectrum (spectral domain) of an image, demonstrating concepts of numerical stability, matrix factorization, and signal processing.
